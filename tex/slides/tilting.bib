  abstract = {Recently, variable selection by penalized likelihood has attracted
	much research interest. In this paper, we propose adaptive Lasso
	quantile regression {(BALQR)} from a Bayesian perspective. The method
	extends the Bayesian Lasso quantile regression by allowing different
	penalization parameters for different regression coefficients. Inverse
	gamma prior distributions are placed on the penalty parameters. We
	treat the hyperparameters of the inverse gamma prior as unknowns
	and estimate them along with the other parameters. A Gibbs sampler
	is developed to simulate the parameters from the posterior distributions.
	Through simulation studies and analysis of a prostate cancer dataset,
	we compare the performance of the {BALQR} method proposed with six
	existing Bayesian and {non-Bayesian} methods. The simulation studies
	and the prostate cancer data analysis indicate that the {BALQR} method
	performs well in comparison to the other approaches.},

Dividend yields predict excess returns only at short horizons together with the short rate and do not have any long-horizon predictive power. At short horizons, the short rate strongly negatively predicts returns. These results are robust in international data and are not due to lack of power. A present value model that matches the data shows that discount rate and short rate movements play a large role in explaining the variation in dividend yields. Finally, we find that earnings yields significantly predict future cash flows. {(JEL} C12, C51, C52, E49, F30, G12)},

	the break dates and present an efficient algorithm to obtain global

	on the principle of dynamic programming and requires at most least-squares
	operations of order {O(T2)} for any number of breaks. Our method
	can be applied to both pure and partial structural change models.
	Second, we consider the problem of forming confidence intervals for
	the break dates under various hypotheses about the structure of the
	data and the errors across segments. Third, we address the issue
	of testing for structural changes under very general conditions on
	the data and the errors. Fourth, we address the issue of estimating

However, contrary to the notion of diversification, {MV} approach often leads to portfolios highly concentrated on a few assets. Also, this method leads to poor out-of-sample performances. Entropy is a well-known measure of diversity and also has a shrinkage interpretation. In this article, we propose to use cross- entropy measure as the objective function with side conditions coming from the mean and variance{\textendash}covariance matrix of the resampled asset returns. This automatically captures the degree of imprecision of input estimates. Our approach can be viewed as a shrinkage estimation of portfolio weights (probabilities) which are shrunk towards the predetermined portfolio, for example, equally weighted portfolio or minimum variance portfolio. Our procedure is illustrated with an application to the international equity indexes.},

	of the investment portfolio that is selected. Given the problem of
	estimation risk, it is natural to formulate rules of portfolio selection
	within a Bayesian framework. In this framework, portfolio selection
	is based on maximization of expected utility conditioned on the predictive
	distribution of security returns. Most researchers have addressed
	the problem of estimation risk by asserting a noninformative diffuse
	prior that reduces the detrimental effect of estimation risk, but
	does not directly reduce estimation error. Portfolio performance
	can be improved by specifying an informative prior that reduces estimation
	error. An informative prior that all securities have identical expected
	returns, variances, and pairwise correlation coefficients is asserted.
	This informative prior reduces estimation error by drawing the posterior
	estimates of each security's expected return, variance, and pairwise
	correlation coefficients toward the average return, average variance,
	and average correlation coefficient, respectively, of all the securities
	in the population. The amount that each of these parameters is drawn
	toward its grand mean depends upon the degree to which the sample
	is consistent with the informative prior. This empirical Bayes method
	is shown to select portfolios whose performance is superior to that

	In this paper, to deal with non-log-concave full conditional distributions,

We find that stocks with favourable (unfavourable) recommendations on average outperformed (underperformed) the benchmark index. An investment strategy using the {Black{\textendash}Litterman} asset allocation model that incorporates consensus analyst recommendations, in conjunction with daily rebalancing, outperforms the market in terms of return and risk-adjusted performance measures. The investment strategy involves high levels of trading, and no significant abnormal returns are achieved after transaction costs. Less frequent rebalancing, under most situations, causes a decrease in both performance and turnover. Filtering of dated recommendations causes an increase in turnover, while having mixed effects on investment returns.},

  abstract = {Estimation risk is known to have a huge impact on mean/variance optimized
	portfolios, which is one of the primary reasons to make standard
	Markowitz optimization unfeasible in practice. This issue has attracted
	new interest in the last years, and several approaches to incorporate
	estimation risk into portfolio selection have been developed only
	recently. In this article, we review these approaches as well as
	some older ones and compare them in an empirical out-of-sample study.
	The approaches can be classified along two criteria. First, we can
	differentiate heuristic approaches (restricting portfolio weights
	and employing simulation techniques) and those based on Bayesian
	statistics (shrinking the portfolios towards a pre-determined target).
	Second, the assumptions about the return-generating process differ,
	either assuming returns to be IID distributed or to be partly predictable.
	The central result of our empirical study is that all of the IID
	approaches, whether they account for estimation risk or not, are
	not superior to simple investment strategies like holding the market
	portfolio. A risk-adjusted outperformance is possible only if sample
	means are substituted with conditional expected return estimates.
	Furthermore, the Bayesian approaches reduce turnover and stabilize
	portfolio weights.},

	than, the frequentist lasso.},

	of the portfolio choice problem and correlation structure of the

	choice strategies turn out to be superior once estimation risk is

	preferences, the choice of the estimator for a given portfolio strategy
	becomes endogenous. We show that a shrinkage approach accounting
	for estimation risk in both, mean and covariance of the return vector,
	is generally superior to simple theoretically suboptimal strategies.
	Moreover, focusing on just one source of estimation risk, e.g. risk
	reduction in covariance estimation, can lead to suboptimal portfolios.},

	Sometimes the risk estimates communicated using these models are

	abstract = {The paper describes a relative entropy procedure for imposing restrictions on simulated forecast distributions from a variety of models. Starting from an empirical forecast distribution for some variables of interest, the technique generates a new empirical distribution that satisfies a set of moment restrictions not used in the construction of the original. The new distribution is informationally as close as possible to the original in the sense of minimizing the {Kullback-Leibler} Information Criterion, or relative entropy. We illustrate the technique with an example related to monetary policy that shows how to introduce restrictions from economic theory into a model's forecasts.},

	minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute
	value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of
	the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients
	that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation
	studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties
	of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable
	models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge
	regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent
	work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The
	lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical
	models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based
	models are briefly described.},

	under certain conditions. In this work we derive a necessary condition
	for the lasso variable selection to be consistent. Consequently,
	there exist certain scenarios where the lasso is inconsistent for
	variable selection. We then propose a new version of the lasso, called
	the adaptive lasso, where adaptive weights are used for penalizing
	different coefficients in the l1 penalty. We show that the adaptive
	lasso enjoys the oracle properties; namely, it performs as well as
	if the true underlying model were given in advance. Similar to the
	lasso, the adaptive lasso is shown to be near-minimax optimal. Furthermore,
	the adaptive lasso can be solved by the same efficient algorithm
	for solving the lasso. We also discuss the extension of the adaptive
	lasso in generalized linear models and show that the oracle properties
	still hold under mild regularity conditions. As a byproduct of our
	theory, the nonnegative garotte is shown to be consistent for variable
	selection.},
